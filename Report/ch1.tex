This section will cover background information on mobile robot kinematic models,
IMU state estimation, Kalman Filtering methods, and cascading KF framework. 


\section{Motivation}

Talk about the development of miniature robots. Talk about our spherical robot design.
The small size of the robot makes it difficult to use a magnetometer due to the close
proximity of the motors and sensors. Using an external sensor is clunky or not
realistic. 

\section{Literature Review}

This section should go over the papers I have gone over. This includes NMNI, NDZTA, 
Song 2018 on the cascaded KF framework, as well as other papers using external 
sensors to get more robust heading. 

\section{Objective}

To tackle these challenges, this thesis aims to find a novel way to estimate
a mobile robots states using only a 6DOF IMU with a unicycle model wheeled mobile 
robot. The thesis will have an algorithm with only a 6DOF IMU as well as having the
option to add an additional sensor to provide more robust localization.
