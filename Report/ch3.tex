\chapter{Future Work}
\label{experimentchapter}

The work left involves simulating the entire framework of the algorithm.
Currently the preprocessing methods are implemented on to the KF blocks and are 
simulated separately. In the future they need to be combined and the performance
needs to be analyzed.

Afterwards, how the optional sensor is to be implemented into the algorithm needs
to be figured out. (Thinking of optimizing a cost function between sensor and position 
from accelerometer to provide best postion estimate then feeding that into the 
KF.)

Finally, implementation on a physical system is left. The planned robot for 
implementation is the Sphero-mini.
